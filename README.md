### 00 Prélude

Your project **MUST** run with **Docker** : Database, server, client, etc.

### 01 Bonjour, Pokémon

You **MUST USE** [json-pokemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-pokemon) package to fill your Mongo database ;<br />
Feel free to architect your collections and documents as you want.

> Tips, create a function that did it

### 02 Hello, API

Create a Node/Typescript API that have the followings routes:

`/pokemons`<br />
`/pokemons/:id ->>  READ | UPDATE (any fields but not the picture) | DELETE`

Each CRUD method **MUST** called mongoose but how ? Directly or via models/schemas wrapper ?

### 03 Salam Postman

Now that your API server is set, let's create a Postman collection that we can share to any developer :)

### 04 Yo, ui

Well, let's visuzalize pokemons datas and interact with your APIs !<br />

You **MUST** create pages using any uix library you want : React.js, Angular.js, Vue, etc.

For each single pokemon page, we must have an edit button for editing any fields and a remove button to delete the pokemon.
